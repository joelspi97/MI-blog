      <h3>What's the purpose of this website?</h3>
      <p>This was one of my very first web development projects. It used to be just an HTML and CSS layout I made when making my first steps into programming. <b>Originally, it had no JavaScript at all.</b></p> 
      <p>It's been almost 2 years since that point and I wanted to update my portfolio and make a project to practice and showcase my NodeJS and Express skills. Since MI Blog already had a decent looking UI interface, I decided to update it and add a little more of complexity by giving it a back-end server.</p>

      <h3>Why is it called MI Blog?</h3>
      <p>This project was originally written in Spanish, but since I wanted it to reach a wider audience, I decided to fully translate it to English. The thing is that the logo already contained those words and since it's an image, I could not change it that easily.</p>
      <p>I decided to keep the word "mi" (which in Spanish means "my") in capital letters so that it would look as if it was some sort of abbreviation.</p> 
      <p><i>Basically; let the users imagine that "M.I." is some kind of cool tech thing they are not aware of, so I can keep it the way it is xd.</i></p>

      <h3>What's next?</h3>
      <p>I'm currently working on a new project for my portfolio. One with a more <i>fancy</i> front end, and a more <b>complex</b> back end.</p>
      <p>That means, instead of just using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS, for the front end, I'm using React and TypeScript, and instead of having a simple CRUD on the back end, it will also have user authentication.</p>
