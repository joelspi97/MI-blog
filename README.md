# MI Blog
This is a project made just for fun and practice.

It features:
* A CRUD system, to allow users interact with a database.
* A form with validation logic, to avoid sending incorrect data to the database. 
* A details page for each item, which allows user to select a specific blog and get more details on it.
* An accessible UI that follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 (AAA).

To build it I used:
* NodeJS
* Express 
* MongoDB 
* JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS3

I don't claim ownership for any of the images used on it.
